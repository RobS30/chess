- game implementation
    - create board
        - what is best way to create board
        - how to represent light vs dark squares, or is that necessary on the back end

    - create pieces
        - pawn
        - knight
        - bishop
        - rook

    - is move valid?
        - king unable to move through check
        - pieces unable to move over each other w exception of knight
        - special cases
            - castling
            - en passant
    - check for win conditions
        - stalemate
        - draw
        - checkmate
